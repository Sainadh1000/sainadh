# Create a class called BankAccount with the following private attributes:

# account_number (string or int)

# account_holder_name (string)

# balance (float)

# 2. Provide public methods to:

# Set account details (account_number, account_holder_name)

# Deposit money

# Withdraw money (only if balance is sufficient)

# Get the current balance

# Display account information (account number, holder name, and balance)

# 3. Ensure proper validation:

# Balance cannot be set or become negative.

# Account number and holder name must be non-empty.

# Deposits and withdrawals must be positive amounts.

# 4. Bonus (Optional):

# Add a transaction history list that logs every deposit and withdrawal.

# Add a method to print the transaction history.

# âœ… Expected Outcome:

# You should be able to:

# Create an account

# Deposit and withdraw money

# View account details

# Ensure data safety through encapsulation (no direct access to sensitive fields)
