# Create a base class PaymentMethod:

# Method: process_payment(amount) â†’ just print a generic message.

# Create three subclasses, each overriding process_payment(amount):

# CreditCardPayment

# Print: "Processing credit card payment of $<amount>"

# PayPalPayment

# Print: "Processing PayPal payment of $<amount>"

# BankTransferPayment

# Print: "Processing bank transfer payment of $<amount>"

# Create a function make_payment(payment_method, amount) that takes a PaymentMethod object and an amount, and calls process_payment().

# Create a list of different payment method objects and simulate payments of varying amounts using a loop and make_payment().
